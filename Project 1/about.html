                    <span class="show">Manhattan</span>
                    <figcaption>Manhattan is one of five boroughs of New York City and has the same boundaries as New York County. Most of the borough consists of Manhattan Island, which is bounded by the Hudson, East and Harlem Rivers, along with some land on the mainland and small islands.

                        Manhattan has an estimated population of 1.63 million people, all living in an area of just 23 square miles. This gives Manhattan a population density of 70,826 people per square mile, or 27,346 per square kilometer. Manhattan is the most densely populated of the five NYC boroughs and also the most densely populated county in the United States. It is more dense than any city in the country and one of the most densely populated areas on earth.

                        On weekdays, the number of commuters pushes the Manhattan population to more than 3.9 million, or 170,000 people per square mile.

                        Manhattan is the smallest borough in terms of land area and the third-largest in terms of population behind Brooklyn and Queens.

                    <figcaption>Brooklyn is New York City's most populous of five boroughs and the second-largest in size. It has the same boundaries as Kings County, which is also the most populous county in the state and the second-most densely populated county in the country after New York County/Manhattan. If it were a city, Brooklyn would be the 4th most populous in the United States.

                        Brooklyn has an estimated population of 2.6 million with a very high population density of 36,732 people per square mile, or 14,182 per square kilometer. The history of the borough goes back 350 years and it has long been known as a popular destination for immigrants to the United States. Brooklyn has many well-known neighborhoods, each reflecting the ever-changing population. The Brownsville neighborhood, for example, had a majority of Jewish people through the middle of the 20th century but it is now mostly African American. Meanwhile, Midwood was mostly Irish during the beginning of the 20th century, then Jewish, and today it has a thriving Pakistani population.</figcaption>

                        Queens was first established in New York as one of the original counties. Upon the consolidation of New York City in the late 19th century, Queens was designated as a borough.

                        Like other New York boroughs, Queens population is spread across many unique neighborhoods. This includes Flushing, Ozone Park, Rockaway Beach and Ridgewood. Each borough has its own identity and ethnic diversity is superfluous in this borough.

The borough has one of the most diverse economies of all of the boroughs and is home to two of the world’s busiest airports. Popular tourist attractions include Citi Field and Flushing Meadows Corona Park.

                        The borough of Queens has seen its population rise steadily throughout the years, with the most notable growth occurring between 1920 and 1930. Between the censuses taken in 2000 and 2010, the population grew just 0.1%.

Its population density is over 35,000 people per square mile, making it the third most densely populated of the five total boroughs.

                        Breaking down the population by race shows that 45.8% of the borough’s population is white. Over 43% of the population is black of African American, over 4% is Asian, 3% are Native American, and over 3% are mixed race. Over 54% of the population is of Hispanic or Latino origin.

                        The population of the Bronx was last estimated to be 1.47 million as of 2017. This reflects growth of over 6% since the last census taken in 2010. The population has seen significant growth since the early 19th century but did see a steep drop in population between 1970 and 1980. However, the population has since rebounded and has not almost reached the peak that was achieved at the time of the 1970 census. Looking back over the last several decades and the growth that has been recorded indicates that this populous borough still has more growth ahead in its future.</figcaption>
